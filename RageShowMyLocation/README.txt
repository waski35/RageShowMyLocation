This plugin adds on top of game window information about current player location (street and city/county).

Plugin displays interstates in red, routes in yellow, other streets in white color.

Plugin displays speed limit at current street, it's based on street location and in some cases player coordinates in game world - as of now it has basic functionality, comparing to this what I planned.

Plugin also displays current time in game, current player speed displayed in MPH or KMPH depending on which system player choosen in options, and direction / heading.

There's ability to configure plugin behaviour via "RageShowMyLocation.ini" file, which includes : metric/imperial units switch, position of text on screen, font size, font family/name - this can be any system font installed in Windows.

There's API for plugin makers in test phase as well allowing to obtain speed limit for given street (name, location) - see develpment forum thread for details - I'll post there some examples.
